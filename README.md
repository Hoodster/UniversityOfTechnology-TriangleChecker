# Triangle Checker #
Project created as homework for The Silesian University Of Technology.

## Problem
The triangle has 3 sides but not all of their lengths can create a triangle. In mathematics, the **triangle inequality** states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.

## Solution
Program asks for 3 numbers. Before checking triangle inequality numbers are sorted from the smallest to the largest and then checks if sum of two smaller numbers are equal or greater than the largest one. If it is program returns information that user can build a triangle using these lenghts.
